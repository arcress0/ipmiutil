IPMIUTIL PROJECT TODO LIST:

IPV6 for IPMI LAN on Windows: 
   Currently support IPV6 on Linux, but need to implement for Windows also
   . implement IPV6 for Windows (#ifdef WIN32 case)
  PARTIAL in ipmiutil-3.1.4 07/18/2019 with HAVE_IPV6, not fully enabled

Thread-safe changes for IPMI LAN:
   Change ipmicmd.c/ipmilan.c to be thread-safe if accessing multiple nodes.
   Currently it is only conditionally safe, if threads access the same node.
   Will require adding a context struct param to the ipmi_cmd*() funcs.  
   May need to add new thread-safe functions to retain back-compatibility.
   PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.9.0, multiple nodes in sequence is fixed
   . need to change to context structure for ipmilan

Add an option/variant of canonical output for CSV (delimiter = ',')
    The current delimiter for -c is '|'

More automated testing
    Started this in ipmiutil-2.6.6 with testipmi.sh, but it could be
    more extensive and be tested on more types of IPMI firmware.
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.6.6 with testipmi.sh

SPD decoding:
   . handle DDR4 SPD format
   . expose SPD decoding from file/buffer, not just FRU
   c handle DDR3 SPD 1.0 format 
   PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.9.1 

Add additional IPMI 2.0 commands from addendum:
   c Get/Set System Info
   c Get/Set SEL UTC Offset (requested 4/22/13)
   . Forwarded Command
   PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.8.1, adding Get/Set System Info functions
   PARTIAL in ipmiutil-3.0.3, adding Get/Set SEL UTC Offset functions

Add more DCMI 1.5 commands for NetFn 0x2C to ipmiutil 
   .   Get/Set DCMI Configuration Parameters  (DCMI 1.5)
   .   Get/Set Thermal Limit  (DCMI 1.5)

Add support for MAC OSX AppleBMC.kext driver
    Not yet implemented, pending some documentation from Apple.

Resolve MS ipmidrv.sys WBEM access memory leak:
   This bug has been reported to Microsoft in Oct 2012 as shown below.
   The workaround is to use the Intel imbdrv.sys driver instead.
   See the ipmiutil UserGuide section 5.1 for details.
   https://sourceforge.net/p/ipmiutil/support-requests/11/
   https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/ca4df181-7fd4-4912-83a0-5896b030e3ca/latest-version-of-microsoft-ipmi-driver-ipmidrvsys?forum=wdk
   OPEN - no update/fix from Microsoft

Remove assert() calls from lanplus code
    Need to improve error handling and remove all assert() calls from 
    the lib/lanplus/ code: lanplus.c lanplus_crypt.c lanplus_crypt_impl.c
    This requires test cases for the assert instances.
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.4.0, removed 2 asserts from lanplus.c
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.7.0, removed 1 more assert from lanplus.c
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.8.8, more from lanplus_crypt.c/lanplus_crypt_impl.c

Add a function to send ctl-alt-del through SOL console
    Although this is seldom used in a serial console environment, it 
    could be useful.  To do this, the one-character escape sequence
    would need to be changed to a 2 character escape sequence.
    Also need a method to insert the key sequence in the console.
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.5.0 includes the 2-character escape sequence
		and a send_break function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ipmiutil_asy.service, ipmiutil_wdt.service

Add IPv6 support 
    There is at least one IPMI BMC that has added IPv6 support, so 
    it would be nice to include support for it in ipmiutil.
    Need access to a BMC that supports IPv6 for testing, or 
    someone to help test it whose BMC supports IPv6.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.7.8, with contribution from Rajaganesh87

Add an option to 'ipmiutil fru' that discovers every child MC FRU also,
like the isensor.c code does for fchild.

    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.6.9

Add more ATCA/picmg functionality.
    Currently have std IPMI functions, plus fru and sensor and blue LED
    capability for ATCA/picmg bladed systems.
    Need to add some additional picmg-specific functionality, like:
      properties     - get PICMG properties
      addrinfo       - get address information
      activate       - activate a FRU
      deactivate     - deactivate a FRU
      policy get     - get the FRU activation policy
      policy set     - set the FRU activation policy
      portstate get  - get port state
      portstate set  - set port state
      led prop       - get led properties
      led cap        - get led color capabilities
      led state get  - get led state
      led state set  - set led state
      power get      - get power level info
      power set      - set power level
   and firmware firewall functions
   COMPLETE: added ipicmg.c and ifirewall.c in ipmiutil-2.6.5

Add older 1.5 SOL protocol capability
    For ipmiutil sol with IPMI 1.5, the older (Intel-only) 1.5 SOL protocol
    is implemented and will connect, but the 1.5 SOL data packets are not
    right yet.  This is in progress.  Note that the standard IPMI 2.0 SOL
    protocol is entirely separate and still works fine.
    Lower priority right now.  If you want to use this feature, email 
         ipmiutil-developers(at)lists.sourceforge.net
    CANCELLED - Intel 1.5 SOL is too old to matter any more. It was
		only supported on SE7501WV2 motherboards from <=2003.

Fix the API interface to /dev/ipmi0 on FreeBSD
    This FreeBSD ipmi driver is different than Linux. 
    We have support for ipmiutil driverless mode on FreeBSD.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.5.2, support ipmi driver and driverless w FreeBSD 7.x

Add a delimeted-output option for all utilities
    Would make parsing the output in scripts easier.
    08/25/08 added ':' delimiters to lan/serial config output in 2.2.0
    PARTIAL in ipmiutil-2.2.0 - added 'ipmiutil config' 
    DONE in ipmiutil-2.4.1 for sensor and lan canonical output with -c
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.5.0  added -c to bmchealth, fruconfig

Add support for a DOS build
    CANCELLED - use Linux boot media instead, DOS is not as good.

Add detection for Windows SOL when Command Prompt window is >25 rows.
    DONE with AnsiTerm.cpp in ipmiutil-2.5.0

Build a bootable Linux CD with ipmiutil for use with other random OSs.
    Note that with ipmiutil-1.7.5, any bootable Linux CD will do, since
    the direct I/Os no longer require an IPMI driver.
    We may still want to build and supply an example (like TRB or SLAX).
    2/06/07 Built an initial SLAX CD as http://ipmiutil.sf.net/ipmiutil.iso.
    This ISO is too big to remain posted on sourceforge.net, however.
    Need documentation on how to build an ISO to finish this. 
    11/21/08 posted SLAX ISO as http://ipmiutil.sf.net/FILES/newgrab.iso
    COMPLETE 

Add Solaris support
    Needed because configuring IPMI LAN and PEF with ipmitool is too
    complicated.  
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.3.0 for Solaris 10 bmc driver
    
Add output logging to ipmiutil sol
    This is easy with stdio in Linux, but not possible in Windows without
    adding a logging option in the code, since Windows uses the video
    console buffer instead of stdio.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.2.2

Add support for Microsoft Windows IPMI driver
    Currently only support Intel Windows imbdrv.sys driver.
    Requires adding WMI infrastructure.
    COMPLETED 09/12/08 in ipmiutil-2.2.1 for 32-bit Win2003R2

Add support for remote soft reset via OpenIPMI driver
    Currently 'ipmiutil reset -o -N' requires 'getevent -a' and the imb driver.
    Requires adding async callback for OpenIPMI driver to getevent.c
    COMPLETED 09/12/08 in ipmiutil-2.2.1

Add a function to save/restore BMC IPMI settings
    This would combine lan, serial, and fru parameters in a key-value-pair
    file that could be restored automatically.
    COMPLETED 08/25/08 in ipmiutil-2.2.0

Eliminate duplication in binaries
    Build only one Meta-command for ipmiutil, with static libs if possible.
    Existing other commands would be sym-links or shortcuts, e.g.
       showsel [args] => ipmiutil sel [args]
    COMPLETED 03/31/08 in ipmiutil-2.1.0 for Linux

Handle Windows command prompt terminal emulation for SOL
    The Windows isolconsole.exe works, but the terminal emulation logic is
    not finished.  It works ok to Linux command-line and vi, but looks
    bad for BIOS/POST.  This is in progress.  There are other (non-open)
    tools available for Windows (e.g. Intel dpccli) in the interim.
    The Linux isolconsole works fine, since the terminal emulation is 
    handled by the Linux termio.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.0.0, no known issues

Do an OS Agent for hwreset to do BMC LAN remote soft-shutdown.
    Perhaps using an xinetd socket to not have a service always resident,
    or sending a kill signal to init from the driver level would work.
    i.e. kill(1,SIGINT); /*SIGINT==2*/
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-2.0.0 with hwreset & "getevent -a" for IMB driver.

Do a configure option with/without lanplus support, since this adds so
much size to the binary object code.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.8.2

Include IPMI v2.0 RMCP+ LAN protocol also.  
    (IPMI 2.0 commands were previously supported, however.)
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.8.0

Add more boot parameters to hwreset, for things like:
   . hwreset: Set which device to boot from (CD, Disk, LAN/PXE, etc.)
     COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.7.0
   . Forcing the boot to continue (i.e. no POST pause) - BIOS setting
     REJECTED - too platform specific for this project, see platform vendor
   . Set which OS/Software version/target to be downloaded for PXE (?)
     REJECTED - too platform specific for this project, see platform vendor

Make a real-time sensor monitoring tool to monitor a specified SDR for
sensor readings every second.
   . partially complete with sensor -i option
   . sensor 1.39 has -L option for looping
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.7.3 (sensor 1.39) 

Add encrypt/decrypt options to pefconfig & tmconfig, using RSA or DSA public 
keys, perhaps with the gnupg.org library.
   There is some concern about increasing the size of the utilities for 
   encryption, when this functionality can be scripted instead.
   POSTPONED - perhaps someone else would like to help? 
   COMPLETE - using -E to get password from IPMI_PASSWORD environment 
              variable works, and does not put the password in the 
              command line or script.
   ADDED -Y option to allow user to enter password at prompt w ipmiutil-1.9.0

Improve BMC LAN functionality and diagnosis with some custom IPMI LAN logic.
   The built-in IPMI LAN also makes the Windows version able to use it.
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.7.0 with ipmilan.c

pefconfig: Fix fSOL20 logic to work on supported platforms, currently 
    returns completion code 0x80.
    COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.6.5

Update hpiutil source for 1.1.9 changes
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.6.3

Add pre-built Windows *.exe files to the ipmiutil.sf.net home page.
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.6.3

sensor: Add an option to display timestamp for this run.  Write it on each SDR line if -w is also specified.
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.5.6

fruconfig: Get FRU data from all FRU devices, not just baseboard.
   COMPLETE in ipmiutil-1.5.6

Add User settings, like tmconfig has, to pefconfig
   - added more Get User Access messages to pefconfig v1.30 in ipmiutil 1.4.9
   - added -u option with ipmiutil 1.5.3
   COMPLETE

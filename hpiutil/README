hpiutil

OVERVIEW

The HPI utilities package provides system management utilities that
conform to the SA Forum's Hardware Platform Interface specification, and
as such are hardware-independent across platforms that have an HPI
library implementation.  The HPI library on Intel platforms requires
an IPMI driver.  An IPMI driver can be provided by either the Intel
IPMI driver (/dev/imb) or the OpenIPMI driver (/dev/ipmi0) in Linux
kernel versions 2.4.20 and greater.  

This Intel HPI library is currently configured to use the /dev/imb 
interface, since that will coexist well with Intel Server Management 
software.  The hpiutil rpms default to the /dev/imb interface.  
Note that the OpenIPMI driver also has imb emulation
as an option.

To switch to using the OpenIPMI driver's /dev/ipmi0 interface with 
this hpiutil package, do this after installing the rpm:
   cp /usr/lib/libSpiModIpmi.so      /usr/lib/libSpiModIpmi.so-imb
   cp /usr/lib/libSpiModIpmi.so-open /usr/lib/libSpiModIpmi.so
   sed -e 's/imb/ipmi0/' /etc/hpi/spi-daemon.conf >/tmp/spi
   cp /tmp/spi /etc/hpi/spi-daemon.conf

This package includes the Intel HPI binary libraries and the 
following HPI utilities.
   hpialarmpanel
   hpisel
   hpifru
   hpisensor
   hpireset
   hpiwdt

NOTES
This package uses the Intel HPI library implementation, but there
is also an OpenHPI library implementation that could also be linked
with these utilities.  There are comments in the Makefile to show
how this can be done. 
The hpiutil utilities are included in OpenHPI 1.0.0 and greater 
as openhpi-clients.
The openhpi-2.6.3 and greater releases with the ipmidirect plugin
have been tested to work well on IPMI systems.

Variations from HPI 1.0 spec:

- SystemGUID added.  Implemented as a FRU Product Custom field.
  The IPMI SystemGUID was not supported in the HPI FRU fields.
  This library implementation shows SystemGUID as part of FRU, but 
  does not try to write GUID as part of FRU.
  See HPI 1.0 spec errata #66

- Power down added to Chassis/Cold Reset RDR via ControlStateSet(OFF)
  There was no mechanism defined in the HPI 1.0 spec to support chassis 
  power down.  Here is the way this was implemented with this library. 
  Doing ControlStateSet(ON) with the Reset RDR causes a hard reset.
  Doing ControlStateSet(OFF) with the Reset RDR causes a power down.
  See HPI 1.0 spec errata #30

- Alarm LED RDRs were not differentiated.
  This variation is required to implement ControlStateSet for Alarm LEDs.
  See also HPI 1.0 spec errata #75
  The oem field values are used to do this according to the following schema.

  Control.Type Control.OutputType Control.Oem	Meaning
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x10 		Alarm panel Power LED
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x11		Alarm panel Critical LED
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x12 		Alarm panel Major LED
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x13 		Alarm panel Minor LED
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x14 - 0x1F	Alarm panel other LEDs
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x20 - 0x2F	Disk LEDs (if used)
  Digital (=0)	LED (=1)	0x30 - 0x3F	NIC LEDs (if used)
  Analog (=2)	LED (=1)	0x60		Chassis Identify LED
  Analog (=2)	LED (=1)	0x61 - 0x6F	Other Analog LEDs (if used)
  Digital (=0)	Generic (=0)	0x70 - 0x7F	Chassis Reset Control

If problems occur, additional debug information can be obtained by 
editing the SPI_DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL variable in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/hpi 
script to change the log level.
SPI_DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL - Level at which to log debug information. The
                       following list describes each of the logging
                       switches. Multiple switches may be used at once.
                          -l<num>: Logs data at a given level. Where num...
                             1 = Logs debug low through fatal errors.
                             2 = Logs debug high through fatal errors.
                             3 = Logs informational through fatal errors.
                             4 = Logs warnings through fatal errors.
                             5 = Log non-fatal errors and fatal errors.
                             6 = Logs fatal errors only.

                              option must also be set.

TESTING

  The binary HPI libraries included in this package have been tested to be 
  HPI 1.0 compliant via the Intel HPI 1.0 compliance test suite.

  This package has been tested and is supported on the following Intel
  servers:  TSRLT2, TSRMT2, TIGPR2U, TIGPT1U.
  See also http://www.saforum.org for platform support information.
  Most of the utilities (except hpialarmpanel) should work on other
  platforms as well, if they have IPMI 1.5 support.
  Note that mBMC platforms, such as TIGPT1U, do not support the 
  Power On Hours function, which is optional in IPMI 1.5.

  This hpiutil package is not inherently dependent on any OS variance,
  as long as there is an IPMI driver.  However, the version of glibc/gcc
  does matter, since the library includes shared object files.
  This HPI library and the HPI utilities have been tested on the 
  following Linux OSs.  
     RedHat EL 3        (gcc 3.2.3,  glibc 2.3.2)
     RedHat AS 2.1      (gcc 2.96,   glibc 2.2.4)
     RedHat 8.0         (gcc 3.2,    glibc 2.2.93)
     MontaVista CGE 2.1 (gcc 2.95.3, glibc 2.2.3 )
     MontaVista CGE 3.0 (gcc 3.2.1,  glibc 2.2.5)
     MontaVista CGE 3.1 (gcc 3.2.1,  glibc 2.2.5)
  Other Linux OSs should work fine using an rpm with similar gcc/glibc.

hpiutil

BUILD & INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

This package uses the Intel HPI library implementation (closed source), 
but there is also an OpenHPI library implementation that could also be 
linked with these utilities.  There are comments in the Makefile to show
how this can be done.

How to make the utilities:
1) If OpenHPI, edit the makefile to uncomment the 2 lines indicated.
2) do ". env.hpi" or ". env.openhpi" to set the environment variables
3) make clean
4) make

How to make the rpms:
(Only valid for Intel HPI at this time.)
mkrpm  $OS
   where OS = rh80 | as21 | mv21 | mv30 | mv30wv | el3 | mv31

How to install the rpms:
(Only valid for Intel HPI at this time.)
rpm -i  hpiutil-1.0.3-as21.i386.rpm 
   The hpi utilities will be in /usr/bin.
   The SaHpi libraries will be in /usr/lib.
   The *.conf files will be in /etc/hpi.
